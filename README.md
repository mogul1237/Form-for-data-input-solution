This Assignment is based on MGA’s directory at https://www.mga.edu/directory. The goal is to create a form for data input, validate the data entered, and display it back to the user.
Assignment
• Create an HTML/JS form to capture, validate, and display data similar to the 2 screenshots.
• Add an email field
• First Name, Last Name, Email, Department and Title should be required
• Drop-Down list used for selecting a department
• Only good URLs, email addresses and phone numbers can be entered
• If “Dr.” is checked it should precede the name (last screenshot)
• Email Address and Website should have tag on display-side that can be clicked ‘to go there’
• Should be HTML w3c valid and fully functional
• Individual work only! Outcomes should be unique and fulfill above requirements.

Assignment Grading Policy
• Outcomes should be unique and reflect your design choices
• I encourage you to use the validators to find errors in your code
• https://validator.w3.org/ – I will take off for HTML errors
• https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ – I will not take off for CSS errors as long as you’re using CSS correctly. Jigsaw is pretty strict IMHO but it can help you find some errors.
• Assignment should fulfill all required elements and be submitted as a .zip or .rar file to D2L Dropbox
